 * 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
 * <p>
 * You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
 * <p>
 * You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
 * <p>
 * Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
 * Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
